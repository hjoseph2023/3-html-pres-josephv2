The last few moments that we spent together
Before you went away to move on with your life
We saw the sunset on the Toronto river
While laughing and playing games
The only thing on my mind was
What was I gonna do when you left.

I had no one to play games with
No one to laugh with
No one to fight with
I wondered what was I going to do when you left

I saw you leaving on that day 
Me not feeling anything 
But everyday after that 
I wondered when you would come back

Months later I saw you again 
I never showed that I missed you when you came back
You left again after a couple of days 
And then I started wondering again 
What was I gonna do when you left
